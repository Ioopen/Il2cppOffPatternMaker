# Il2cppOffPatternMaker

To make it work, need 4 files

2 Libil2cpp
2 Script.json(from il2cppdumper)

First Set of files that program ask to input, are considered, the previous lowest version, and last set of files are considered newest version of the file,
to input the offsets and the classnames is very similar to the LittleXrefS Previously maded by me, just input and wait, should pop you up with unique patterns found, or no patterns at all.
